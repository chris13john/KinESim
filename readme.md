# KinESim
Igor procedures and examples for simulation of homogeneous and heterogeneous electrochemical reactions

**Important note to the user:** This software requires Igor v. 8.0 to run.

Kin-E-Sim is a set procedures for Igor Pro designed to predict the characteristic response of an analyte in various electrochemical methods, including normal pulsed voltammetry (illustrated below), cyclic voltammetry, etc. This document is intended to provide a new user the information they need to begin using the Kin-E-Sim program. See [citation] for further details on the implemented algorithms. 

Two versions of Kin-E-Sim are provided: `KES__complete.ipf` includes complete code in a single procedure file and is intended for end users.  `KES__Main.ipf` loads the same code which is split over several procedure files. It is intended for programmers who want to examine and revise the code.  Only one version can be loaded at a time. 

## Using KinESim
A [manual](https://github.com/dap-biospec/KinESim/blob/master/KES_manual/KES_manual.md) is provided that includes instructions for [installation](https://github.com/dap-biospec/KinESim/blob/master/KES_manual/KES_manual.md#Installation), a tutorial featuring [demo simulations](https://github.com/dap-biospec/KinESim/blob/master/KES_manual/KES_manual.md#Kin-E-Sim-Demo), and a complete description of the KinESim [control panel](https://github.com/dap-biospec/KinESim/blob/master/KES_manual/KES_manual.md#Control-Panel).

An API can be found [here](https://github.com/dap-biospec/KinESim/blob/master/KES_manual/KES_API.md).
